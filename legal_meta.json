B procures a policy\nfor 4,000 rupees on the ship, and another for the like sum on the cargo. A is bound to pay the premium for the policy on the ship,\nbut not the premium for the policy on the cargo.\n228.Principal not bound when excess of agent’s authority is not separable.—Where an agent\ndoes more than he is authorized to do, and what he does beyond the scope of his authority cannot be\nseparated from what is within it, the principal is not bound to recognize the transaction.\nIllustration\nA authorizes B to buy 500 sheep for him.
